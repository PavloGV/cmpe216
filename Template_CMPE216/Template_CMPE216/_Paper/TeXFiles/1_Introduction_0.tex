\indent Of all the various types of robotic locomotion, a dichotomy can be drawn such that there are two main categories, robots that require pre-established infrastructure and robots that do not. A rumba requires flat surfaces to traverse, where as DARPA's dog can navigate the uneven surface of a grassy hill. Robots that do not require specific environmental geometry can be deployed in countries that have limited infrastructure to deliver important supplies. For disaster relief, supply delivery via all-terrain, long-distance autonomous vehicles can be critical.\\

\indent This paper outlines a proposal for a high-velocity aerial robot drawing
inspiration from hummingbirds. The robot will use near-vertical take-off, requiring no runway. The bio-inspiration comes from the manner in which humming-birds rapidly decelerate. When hummingbirds are in mating season, the males attract females executing a looping \textit{display dive} reaching speeds of up to approximately 27 meters per second, \cite{Clark:2009}. The design will incorporate an initial acceleration mechanism to propel the robot to a high altitude. Once the apex of the trajectory is reached, hummingbird-inspired wings and tail feathers will be deployed to mimic the deceleration.\\

\indent The near-vertical take-off mechanism is inspired from the jumping mechanism of a flea. Fleas are capable of jumping with an acceleration of 102 g-forces, \cite[p.~62]{Bennet:1967}. This is a tremendous acceleration that is not easily reverse engineered. This proposal will explore a design for a jumping mechanism based on  scaling the acceleration capable of fleas, but with a larger mass. A comparison of energy density relative to size of a payload will be made.\\

\indent The basic design of the robot will be broken up in to two main sections: \textbf{1)} the initial acceleration mechanism and \textbf{2)} the deceleration mechanism. A simulation will first be made, and as a stretch-goal, a prototype will be assembled.\\
