Code, simulations, and writing for CMPE216 Bio-Inspired Locomotion

## How to generate the .pdf
Navigate to [cmpe216/Template_CMPE216/Template_CMPE216/_Paper/](./Template_CMPE216/Template_CMPE216/_Paper/) and enter the following command:

`make all`

This uses a simple Makefile that generates the .pdf of the latex template. All that is needed is to fill out the template and its corresponding files.
