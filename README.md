Code, simulations, and writing for CMPE216 Bio-Inspired Locomotion

## How to generate the .pdf
Navigate to [cmpe216/FleaSlug/Paper/](../cmpe216/FleaSlug/Paper/) and enter the following command:

`make all`

or if you are using sublime text and use the build option with the make file, you can do the following:

'command b' 

This uses a simple Makefile that generates the .pdf and a few other file types that can be ignored.
