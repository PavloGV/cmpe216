A male with a body 67 mm long and weighing 0.28 g can jump 90 cm with a take-off angle of 40 ° and velocity of 2.5 m s–1, requiring an energy expenditure of 850 µJ. The body is accelerated at 165 m s–2 for only 30 ms. The larger and heavier females (mean body length 104 mm and weighing 1.5 g) can jump on average a distance of 49 cm.},

	abstract = {Joint Action
Many small insects are impressive jumpers, but large leaps and small bodies pose biomechanical challenges. Burrows and Sutton (p. 1254) show that the nymphal planthopper Issus has interlocking gears on their hindleg trochanters that act together to cock the legs synchronously before triggering forward jumps. At the final molt, the gears are swapped for a high-performance friction-based mechanism because the risk of breaking a gear is high, the options for repair during molting are gone, and, moreover, the animal is bigger and stronger.
Gears are found rarely in animals and have never been reported to intermesh and rotate functionally like mechanical gears. We now demonstrate functional gears in the ballistic jumping movements of the flightless planthopper insect Issus. The nymphs, but not adults, have a row of cuticular gear (cog) teeth around the curved medial surfaces of their two hindleg trochantera. The gear teeth on one trochanter engaged with and sequentially moved past those on the other trochanter during the preparatory cocking and the propulsive phases of jumping. Close registration between the gears ensured that both hindlegs moved at the same angular velocities to propel the body without yaw rotation. At the final molt to adulthood, this synchronization mechanism is jettisoned.
Functional gears are involved in the ballistic jumping movements of the flightless planthopper insect, Issus.

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section
The present study analyses the anatomy, mechanics and functional morphology of the jumping apparatus, the performance and the kinematics of the natural jump of flea beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae: Alticini). The kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the jump were calculated for five species from five genera (average values from minimum to maximum): acceleration 0.91–2.25 (×103) m s−2, velocity 1.48–2.80 m s−1, time to take-off 1.35–2.25 ms, kinetic energy 2.43–16.5 µJ, g-force 93–230. The jumping apparatus is localized in the hind legs and formed by the femur, tibia, femoro-tibial joint, modified metafemoral extensor tendon, extensor ligament, tibial flexor sclerite, and extensor and flexor muscles. The primary role of the metafemoral extensor tendon is seen in the formation of an increased attachment site for the extensor muscles. The rubber-like protein resilin was detected in the extensor ligament, i.e. a short, elastic element connecting the extensor tendon with the tibial base. The calculated specific joint power (max. 0.714 W g−1) of the femoro-tibial joint during the jumping movement and the fast full extension of the hind tibia (1–3 ms) suggest that jumping is performed via a catapult mechanism releasing energy that has beforehand been stored in the extensor ligament during its stretching by the extensor muscles. In addition, the morphology of the femoro-tibial joint suggests that the co-contraction of the flexor and the extensor muscles in the femur of the jumping leg is involved in this process.},

Navigating complex environments, however, requires the use of omni-directional dynamic maneuvers for traversing obstacles in conﬁned spaces. This paper introduces GOAT, the Gearless Omnidirectional Acceleration-vectoring Topology — a novel 3-DoF, 3RSR leg topology combined with a direct-drive or quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation scheme to enable high ﬁdelity proprioceptive force control and multi-modal mobility via high-energy, omni-directional jumping, running, and walking. GOAT’s kinematics, mechanical design, actuation, drive electronics, and control algorithms are presented. Experimental results successfully demonstrate a mechanically robust GOAT leg performing a) explosive vertical jumping up to 82 cm b) landing using high ﬁdelity virtual compliance and c) high-speed omnidirectional running/jumping trajectories while mounted on a test rig.},

Our primary focus was to enable the robot to return to a wall after jumping and then cling to the wall without falling. This paper presents a robot with a tail that is specially equipped with a mass load capable of altering the posture of the robot in midair, thereby enabling it to return to the surface of the wall without the need for any other external force. This study explored the changes in posture induced by this mechanism and observed jumping performance and posture changes based on the trajectory of the claw tips and the overall movement of the robot while jumping. After adjusting the design parameters, a series of jumping experiments was conducted to verify that the climbing robot could adjust its posture using the tail action after jumping.},
